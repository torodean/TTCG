Basic Rules
===========

### Deck Construction
- Each player must construct a deck with a minimum of 50 cards and maximum of 70 cards.
- A player can have no more than 2 copies of the same card (across all rarities) in their deck.
- A deck may contain any ratio of creature and magic cards.

### Game Start
- To decide who goes first, any random method can be used (e.g., coin toss, age, agreement).
  - The default method for official play should be the roll of a die (assign one player as even, and another as odd).
- Each player begins the game by drawing 5 cards.
- The first player cannot attack on their first turn nor draw at the start of their turn.

### Turn Structure
Each player's turn consists of three phases:
1. **Draw Phase**: At the start of every turn (except the first player's first turn), the player draws a card.
2. **Main Phase**:
   - A player may play up to two cards to their field (unless a card specifies otherwise).
   - A card effect that plays a card to the field does not count toward this limit.
3. **Battle Phase**: Combat and attacks occur.

### Playing Cards
- A card can be played to the field in either face-up or face-down position.
- **Magic Cards**:
  - If played face-down, they can be flipped face-up at any time after that turn during either player's turn.
  - If played face-down, they cannot be activated until at least the next turn.
- **Creature Cards**:
  - If played face-down, they can only be changed to face-up when:
    - They are attacked by an opponent.
    - The player who played them chooses to flip them during their turn.
  - When a creature is leveled up, the new creature can also be played in face up or face down position.

### Card Effects
- Every card has two effects.
- All rules and effects are able to be overruled if a card effect explicitely states that it does so.
- Most effects can be activated at any time while the card is face-up on the field.
- If multiple effects trigger at the same time, the effects will activate in reverse order of activation.
  - If an effect is no longer valid because of this order, the effect simply does nothing (but still counts as activated).
- **Creature Cards**:
  - When a creature effect is activated, that card is then tapped.
  - Tapped cards cannot activate effects.
  - A creature card can attack whether tapped or not.
- **Magic Cards**:
  - When a magic card effect is activated (unless it is a continuous effect), that card is sent to the discard pile.
- **Effect Conditions**:
  - If a card effect activates when the card is sent to the discard pile or deck, it can only be activated if the card was initially untapped.
  - Cards in the hand, deck, and discard pile are considered untapped.
  - A card effect cannot be activated if it is destroyed (unless a card states otherwise).
- **Effect Types**:
  - Normal: A Normal effect is one that can be activated during your turn by tapping the card.
  - Continuous: This effect is activated like a normal effect, but stays active while the card is on the field.
  - Counter: This effect can be activated at any time in response to an opponents action.
  - Equip: This card is 'equip' to another card and remains active until the other card or this card is destroyed.
  - Latent: This effect is triggered only when this card is currently untapped and meets some specific trigger condition. 
  - Dormant: This is an effect that can only be activated when the card is tapped. These effects cannot be activated the same turn the card was tapped.

### Leveling Up
- Any card with a level higher than one can only be played to the field by leveling up another card of the same type.
- To level up a card, place a card with the same type and one level higher on top of that card.
- All cards under the card played are considered underneath that card and are immediately untapped.
- All cards underneat another card remain on the field until the top card of their pile is destroyed.
- Cards underneath another do not count towards the field creature limit.

### Battle Phase
- The last part of a players turn is the battle phase.
- Every creature a player owns can attack once during the owner players Battle Phase.
- If the opponent controls any creatures, the attacker must target one of them..
- If an opponent has no creatures remaining, a creature can attack the opponent directly.
- When a creature attacks, the attack value is used to determine its strength.
- When a creature is defending, the defense value is used to determine its strength.
- During an attack, whichever creature has the higher power level prevails, and the other is destroyed (unless a card states otherwise).

### Gaining Points
- Every player starts the game with 20 points.
- To gain points, you must destroy creatures on your opponents side of the field.
- When a creature is destroyed, the owner of that creature loses points equal to the level of that creature.
- During a players battle phase, if there are no creatures on the opponents side of the field, a creature can attack directly and the opposing player loses points equal to the level of the attacking creatures.
- Players can also gain or lose points based on various card effects.

### Field Limitations
- A players field is split into two parts (upper for creatures, and lower for magic cards).
- A players upper field can support a maximum of 5 creature cards.
- A players lower field can support a maximum of 5 magic cards.

### Hand Size Limit
- Players may hold a maximum of 10 cards in their hand.
- At the end of their turn, if a player has more than 10 cards, they must discard down to 10.

### Deck Exhaustion Rule
- If a player cannot draw a card because their deck is empty, they take 5 points of damage instead.
- This damage occurs at the start of their Draw Phase each turn that they are unable to draw.
