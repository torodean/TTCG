Basic Rules
===========

### Deck Construction
- Each player must construct a deck with a minimum of 50 cards and maximum of 70 cards.
- A player can have no more than 2 copies of the same card (across all rarities) in their deck.

### Game Start
- To decide who goes first, any random method can be used (e.g., coin toss, age, agreement).
- Each player begins the game by drawing 5 cards.
- The first player cannot attack on their first turn nor draw at the start of their turn.

### Turn Structure
Each player's turn consists of three phases:
1. **Draw Phase**: At the start of every turn (except the first player's first turn), the player draws a card.
2. **Main Phase**:
   - A player may play up to two cards to their field (unless a card specifies otherwise).
   - A card effect that plays a card to the field does not count toward this limit.
3. **Battle Phase**: Combat and attacks occur.

### Playing Cards
- A card can be played to the field in either face-up or face-down position.
- **Magic Cards**:
  - If played face-down, they can be flipped face-up at any time after that turn during either player's turn.
- **Creature Cards**:
  - If played face-down, they can only be changed to face-up when:
    - They are attacked by an opponent.
    - The player who played them chooses to flip them during their turn.

### Card Effects
- Every card has two effects.
- Most effects can be activated at any time while the card is face-up on the field.
- **Creature Cards**:
  - When a creature effect is activated, that card is then tapped.
  - Tapped cards cannot activate effects.
  - A creature card can attack whether tapped or not.
- **Magic Cards**:
  - When a magic card effect is activated (unless it is a continuous effect), that card is sent to the discard pile.
- **Effect Conditions**:
  - If a card effect activates when the card is sent to the discard pile or deck, it can only be activated if the card was initially untapped.
  - Cards in the hand, deck, and discard pile are considered untapped.
  - A card effect cannot be activated if it is destroyed (unless a card states otherwise).
- **Effect Types**:
  - Normal: A Normal effect is one that can be activated during your turn by tapping the card.
  - Continuous: This effect is activated like a normal effect, but stays active while the card is on the field.
  - Counter: This effect can be activated at any time in response to an opponents action.
  - Equipt: This card is 'equipt' to another card and remains active until the other card or this card is destroyed.
  - Latent: This effect is triggered only when this card is currently untapped and meets some specific trigger condition.
