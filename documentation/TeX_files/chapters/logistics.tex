\section{Card Types}

There are two primary categories of cards - unit cards (or units for short) and spell cards (or spells for short). Every card has a card `type' associated with it. Spell cards are differentiated in their function and purpose, but are simply a card with the type of `spell'. The unit cards encompass all of the remaining card types. Every unit card also has one or more sub-type(s) (also called secondary type(s)), which is a more focused type specific to the card itself (primarily the art/lore of the unit).

\subsubsection{Types}
The primary types, of which each card is assigned one, are listed below with a brief description.
\begin{description}
  \item[Earth:] Units aligned with nature, resilience, and the physical world. Earth units often have high defense and abilities that enhance survivability.
  \item[Water:] Units embodying fluidity, adaptability, and the power of the seas. Water units typically specialize in control effects and healing.
  \item[Fire:] Units representing destruction, passion, and chaotic power. Fire units are known for high attack values and aggressive effects.
  \item[Air:] Units characterized by speed, agility, and freedom. Air units often have evasion abilities and excel at quick, tactical strikes.
  \item[Electric:] Units aligned with energy, and the power of electricity. Electrical units often have abilities focused on stunning enemies, or interupting other cards.
  \item[Light:] Units symbolizing purity, order, and restoration. Light units frequently provide healing, support, and protective effects.
  \item[Dark:] Units associated with corruption, death, and forbidden power. Dark units excel at destruction, disruption, and sacrificial effects.
  \item[Spell:] Non-unit cards that represent magical powers, blessings, equipment, spell effects, artifacts, curses, or more. Spells provide a wide range of one-time or ongoing effects to influence the game.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Sub-Types}
The secondary types, of which each unit card is assigned one or more, are listed below with a brief description.
\begin{description}
  \item[Dragon:] Powerful, mythical beings with immense strength and destructive capabilities.
  \item[Beast:] Natural creatures with raw physical power, often found in forests and plains.
  \item[Elemental:] Manifestations of elemental forces, bound to the magic of nature.
  \item[Aquatic:] Sea-dwelling creatures adept at controlling water and adapting to fluid environments.
  \item[Warrior:] Skilled fighters trained in physical combat, often acting as frontline attackers.
  \item[Spellcaster:] Mystics and mages who wield magical powers to cast spells and manipulate the battlefield.
  \item[Machine:] Artificial constructs built for labor, warfare, or magical purposes.

  \item[Fairy:] Small, magical beings capable of blessings, mischief, and subtle manipulations.

\subsection{Effect Conditions}
Many effects have a condition that must be met in order to use the effect or as part of the effect's actions. A list of these conditions follows with a brief description of what they mean.
\begin{description}
  \item["Discard one card to...":] The player must choose and discard one card from their hand to activate the effect of the card. Sometimes this condition is further specific, in which case the player must choose and discard one card matching the exact condition to activate the effect of the card. The  follow-up effect is considered activated after the action of discarding the card.
  \item["Discard this card to...":] The player must discard the specific card to trigger its effect, often a one-time cost for a powerful result. The  follow-up effect is considered activated after the action of discarding the card.
  \item["If you have...":] A condition based on whether the player has a specific card, type, or number of cards in play or in hand (e.g., "If you have a Fire unit on the field...").
  \item["Let your opponent...":] The player allows the opponent to perform a specific action or gain some benefit, often with a trade-off for the player. The follow-up effect is considered activated after the action done by the opponent and can only be activated if the opponent successfully takes that action.
  \item["Lose X point(s) to...":] The player must sacrifice a certain amount of points (e.g., life points, mana) to trigger the effect. The follow-up effect is considered activated after the player loses the point(s).
  \item["This turn...":] The effect lasts or can only be used within the current turn, typically providing a temporary advantage or ability.
  \item["While this card remains on the field...":] The effect remains active as long as the card stays in play, often providing continuous benefits or penalties.
  \item["When this card is send to the discard pile...":] This effect is triggered when the card is discarded or destroyed, usually offering a secondary benefit upon leaving the field. A card must be considered untapped to activate this effect. The follow-up effect is considered activated after the card is sent to the discard pile.
  \item["When another card is destroyed...":] This condition activates the effect when a different card is destroyed, potentially creating a chain reaction. The follow-up effect is considered activated after the other card is destroyed.
  \item["When an enemy card attacks...":] The effect activates when an enemy unit declares an attack, providing defensive actions, counterattacks, or interrupts. The follow-up effect is activated before the attack.
  \item["If you control...":] A condition based on controlling a specific unit or type of unit, or having a certain number of cards in play.
  \item["At the start of your turn...":] The effect triggers automatically at the beginning of the player's turn, typically with a passive or setup ability.
  \item["After this card attacks...":] The effect occurs after the card has attacked, often used for follow-up actions or penalties. The follow-up effect is activated after the attack is finished.
  \item["When this card attacks...":] The effect occurs after the card has attacked, often used for follow-up actions or penalties. The follow-up effect is activated before the attack.
  \item["During your opponent's phase..."]  The effect activates during the opponent's phase (the exact phase will be specified by the card), often to disrupt or delay their strategy.
