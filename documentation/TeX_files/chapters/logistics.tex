\section{Card Types}

There are two primary categories of cards - unit cards (or units for short) and spell cards (or spells for short). Every card has a card `type' associated with it. Spell cards are differentiated in their function and purpose, but are simply a card with the type of `spell'. The unit cards encompass all of the remaining card types. Every unit card also has one or more sub-type(s) (also called secondary type(s)), which is a more focused type specific to the card itself (primarily the art/lore of the unit).

\subsubsection{Types}
The primary types, of which each card is assigned one, are listed below with a brief description.
\begin{description}
  \item[Earth:] Units aligned with nature, resilience, and the physical world. Earth units often have high defense and abilities that enhance survivability.
  \item[Water:] Units embodying fluidity, adaptability, and the power of the seas. Water units typically specialize in control effects and healing.
  \item[Fire:] Units representing destruction, passion, and chaotic power. Fire units are known for high attack values and aggressive effects.
  \item[Air:] Units characterized by speed, agility, and freedom. Air units often have evasion abilities and excel at quick, tactical strikes.
  \item[Light:] Units symbolizing purity, order, and restoration. Light units frequently provide healing, support, and protective effects.
  \item[Dark:] Units associated with corruption, death, and forbidden power. Dark units excel at destruction, disruption, and sacrificial effects.
  \item[Spell:] Non-unit cards that represent magical powers, blessings, equipment, spell effects, artifacts, curses, or more. Spells provide a wide range of one-time or ongoing effects to influence the game.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Sub-Types}
The secondary types, of which each unit card is assigned one or more, are listed below with a brief description.
