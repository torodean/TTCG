\section{Card Types}

There are two primary categories of cards - unit cards (or units for short) and spell cards (or spells for short). Every card has a card `type' associated with it. Spell cards are differentiated in their function and purpose, but are simply a card with the type of `spell'. The unit cards encompass all of the remaining card types. Every unit card also has one or more sub-type(s) (also called secondary type(s)), which is a more focused type specific to the card itself (primarily the art/lore of the unit).
