\section{Basic Rules}

\subsection{Deck Construction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each player must construct a deck with a minimum of 50 cards and maximum of 70 cards.
    \item A player can have no more than 2 copies of the same card (across all rarities) in their deck.
    \item A deck may contain any ratio of creature and magic cards.
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Game Start}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To decide who goes first, any random method can be used (e.g., coin toss, age, agreement). The default method for official play should be the roll of a die (assign one player as even, and another as odd).
    \item Each player begins the game by drawing 5 cards.
    \item The first player to play cannot attack on their first turn nor draw at the start of their turn.
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Turn Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each player's turn consists of three phases:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item \textbf{Draw Phase}: At the start of every turn (except the first player's first turn), the player draws a card.
	    \item \textbf{Main Phase}:
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item A player may play up to two cards to their field (unless a card specifies otherwise).
	        \item A card effect that plays a card to the field does not count toward this limit.
	    \end{itemize}
	    \item \textbf{Battle Phase}: Combat and attacks occur.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Playing Cards}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A card can be played to the field in either face-up or face-down position.
    \item \textbf{Magic Cards:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If played face-down, they can be flipped face-up at any time after that turn during either player's turn.
        \item If played face-down, they cannot be activated until at least the next turn.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Creature Cards:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If played face-down, they can only be changed to face-up when attacked or voluntarily flipped by the player during their turn.
        \item An attacked creature card is always flipped face up by the attack.
        \item When a creature is leveled up, the new creature can also be played in face up or face down position.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}






\subsection{Card Effects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every card has two effects.
    \item All rules and effects are able to be overruled if a card effect explicitly states that it does so.
    \item Most effects can be activated at any time while the card is face-up on the field.
    \item If multiple effects trigger at the same time, they activate in reverse order of activation. If an effect is no longer valid because of this order, the effect simply does nothing (but still counts as activated).
    \item Tapped creature cards cannot activate effects.
    \item \textbf{Creature Cards:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When a creature effect is activated, that card is then tapped.
        \item Tapped cards cannot activate effects.
        \item A creature card can attack whether tapped or not.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Magic Cards:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When a magic card effect is activated (unless it is a continuous effect), that card is sent to the discard pile.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Effect Conditions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a card effect activates when the card is sent to the discard pile or deck, it can only be activated if the card was initially untapped.
        \item Cards in the hand, deck, and discard pile are considered untapped.
        \item A card effect cannot be activated if it is destroyed (unless a card states otherwise).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Effect Types:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Normal: A Normal effect is one that can be activated during your turn by tapping the card.
        \item Continuous: This effect is activated like a normal effect, but stays active while the card is on the field.
		\item Counter: This effect can be activated at any time in response to an opponents action.
		\item Equip: This card is 'equip' to another card and remains active until the other card or this card is destroyed. When a card is destroyed, all equip cards connected to that card are destroyed with it.
		\item Latent: This effect is triggered only when this card is currently untapped and meets some specific trigger condition. 
		\item Dormant: This is an effect that can only be activated when the card is tapped. These effects cannot be activated the same turn the card was tapped.
  		\item Passive: This effect is always active and is triggered whenever the effect conditions are met.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Leveling Up}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any card with a level higher than one can only be played to the field by leveling up another card of the same type.
    \item To level up a card, place a card with the same type and one level higher on top of that card.
    \item All cards under the card played are considered underneath that card and are immediately untapped.
    \item All cards underneat another card remain on the field until the top card of their pile is destroyed.
    \item Cards underneath another do not count towards the field creature limit.
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Battle Phase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The last part of a players turn is the battle phase.
    \item Every creature a player owns can attack once during the owner players Battle Phase.
    \item If the opponent controls any creatures, the attacker must target one of them..
    \item If an opponent has no creatures remaining, a creature can attack the opponent directly.
    \item When a creature attacks, the attack value is used to determine its strength.
    \item When a creature is defending, the defense value is used to determine its strength.
    \item During an attack, whichever creature has the higher power level prevails, and the other is destroyed (unless a card states otherwise).
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Gaining Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every player starts the game with 20 points.
    \item To gain points, you must destroy creatures on your opponents side of the field.
    \item When a creature is destroyed, the owner of that creature loses points equal to the level of that creature.
    \item During a players battle phase, if there are no creatures on the opponents side of the field, a creature can attack directly and the opposing player loses points equal to the level of the attacking creatures.
    \item Players can also gain or lose points based on various card effects.
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Field Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A players field is split into two parts (upper for creatures, and lower for magic cards).
    \item A players upper field can support a maximum of 5 creature cards.
    \item A players lower field can support a maximum of 5 magic cards.
\end{itemize}








\subsection{Hand Size Limit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Players may hold a maximum of 10 cards in their hand.
    \item At the end of their turn, if a player has more than 10 cards, they must discard down to 10.
\end{itemize}







\subsection{Deck Exhaustion Rule}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If a player cannot draw a card because their deck is empty, they take 5 points of damage instead.
    \item This damage occurs at the start of their Draw Phase each turn that they are unable to draw.
\end{itemize}
