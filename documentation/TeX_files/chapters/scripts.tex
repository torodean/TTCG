\section{Create Effect Combinations}
\subsection{Overview}
The \texttt{create\_effect\_combinations.py} script is a Python 3 tool designed to generate all possible combinations of a sentence or set of sentences by replacing placeholders with values defined in external text files. It is ideal for creating permutations of text templates, such as game effects, test cases, or parameterized strings, where placeholders (e.g., \texttt{<rank>}) represent variable elements. The tool supports nested placeholders, numeric offsets (e.g., \texttt{<rank+1>}), and configurable post-processing to clean, filter, and refine the output.

This script automates the generation of exhaustive text combinations, with output that can be written to a file or displayed in the terminal. Configuration files enhance flexibility by allowing users to customize filtering and phrase replacements without modifying the source code.

\subsection{Purpose}
The \texttt{create\_effect\_combinations.py} script aims to streamline the creation of text variations from templates. Common use cases include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating card or spell effects for games (e.g., "Draw \texttt{<number>} cards").
    \item Producing test data for software validation.
    \item Creating parameterized strings for simulations or documentation.
\end{itemize}
By leveraging recursive placeholder resolution and user-defined configuration files, it ensures comprehensive and polished results with minimal manual effort.

\subsection{Features}
The tool provides the following key features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Placeholder Substitution}: Replaces placeholders (e.g., \texttt{<rank>}) with values from text files in a specified directory (default: \texttt{placeholders/}).
    \item \textbf{Nested Placeholder Support}: Recursively resolves nested placeholders (e.g., \texttt{<effect>} containing \texttt{<number>}).
    \item \textbf{Offset Handling}: Adjusts numeric placeholders with offsets (e.g., \texttt{<rank+1>}, \texttt{<rank-1>}).
    \item \textbf{Input Flexibility}: Processes a single sentence (\texttt{-s}) or a file of sentences (\texttt{-f}, default: \texttt{effects/all\_effect\_templates.txt}).
    \item \textbf{Output Customization}: Writes combinations to a file (default: \texttt{effects/all\_effects.txt}) or outputs to the terminal in test mode (\texttt{-t}).
    \item \textbf{Configurable Post-Processing}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Removes duplicates, preserving the order of first appearance.
            \item Filters out unwanted phrases defined in a configuration file (default: \texttt{placeholders/combinations\_to\_remove.txt}).
            \item Replaces phrases with designated alternatives from a configuration file (default: \texttt{placeholders/phrase\_replacements.txt}).
            \item Alphabetizes the final list for readability.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deduplication Utility}: Offers a standalone mode (\texttt{-d}) to remove duplicate lines from a file.
    \item \textbf{Error Handling}: Manages missing files, empty inputs, and recursive placeholder cycles (unresolved as, e.g., \texttt{<rank>}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuration Files}
The script uses two configuration files to customize post-processing, both supporting comments (lines starting with \texttt{\#}) for documentation or disabling rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{placeholders/combinations\_to\_remove.txt}}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Purpose}: Specifies phrases to exclude from the generated combinations, such as invalid or undesirable outputs.
            \item \textit{Format}: One phrase per line. Empty lines and comments (\texttt{\#}) are ignored.
            \item \textit{Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}
1 or lower
# Exclude higher ranks for now
5 or higher
spell creature
\end{lstlisting}
            \item \textit{Effect}: Combinations containing these phrases (e.g., "Draw 1 or lower cards") are filtered out.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{placeholders/phrase\_replacements.txt}}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Purpose}: Defines phrase replacements to refine grammar or correct errors in the output.
            \item \textit{Format}: Key-value pairs in the form \texttt{old phrase: new phrase}, one per line. Empty lines and comments (\texttt{\#}) are ignored.
            \item \textit{Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}
# Fix pluralization
one point(s): one point
two card(s): two cards
# Temporary disable this:
# three spell(s): three spells
spellscaster: spellcaster
\end{lstlisting}
            \item \textit{Effect}: Replaces matching phrases (e.g., "one point(s)" becomes "one point") in all combinations.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Both files are optional; if missing, the script proceeds without filtering or replacements, respectively, and issues a warning.

\section{Add CSV Field}
\subsection{Overview}
The \texttt{add\_csv\_field.py} script is a Python 3 tool designed to process text or CSV files containing effects (e.g., game card descriptions) and generate or update a CSV file with a custom column indicating whether each effect matches a specified pattern or substring. It supports two modes: pattern matching with placeholder expansion (e.g., \texttt{<number> cards}) and exact substring matching. The script integrates with a directory of placeholder files to resolve patterns dynamically, making it versatile for analyzing structured text data.

This tool is particularly useful for annotating datasets, such as marking effects that contain specific keywords or structures, and outputs results in a semicolon-delimited CSV format for easy integration with other tools or analysis workflows.

\subsection{Purpose}
The \texttt{add\_csv\_field.py} script aims to automate the annotation of effects by adding or updating a boolean column in a CSV file based on user-defined criteria. Common use cases include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tagging game effects that match specific patterns (e.g., "Draw \texttt{<number>} cards") for categorization.
    \item Validating or auditing text data by marking entries with exact substrings.
    \item Preparing datasets for further processing or analysis by adding metadata columns.
\end{itemize}
By leveraging placeholder resolution and flexible input handling, it simplifies the task of identifying and labeling patterns in text.

\subsection{Features}
The script offers the following key features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dual Input Support}: Processes plain text files (one effect per line) or semicolon-delimited CSV files with an \texttt{EFFECTNAME} column.
    \item \textbf{Pattern Matching}: Checks for patterns with placeholders (e.g., \texttt{Destroy <number> cards}), expanding them using values from placeholder files in a specified directory (default: \texttt{placeholders/}).
    \item \textbf{Exact Substring Matching}: Sets a column to \texttt{True} for effects containing an exact substring (e.g., \texttt{Draw two}).
    \item \textbf{Column Management}: Adds a new column if it doesn’t exist or updates an existing column, setting \texttt{True} where matches occur (preserving \texttt{True} values in updates).
    \item \textbf{Placeholder Resolution}: Recursively resolves nested placeholders in patterns, using the same logic as \texttt{create\_effect\_combinations.py}.
    \item \textbf{Output Format}: Generates a semicolon-delimited CSV with at least two columns: \texttt{EFFECTNAME} and the user-specified column.
    \item \textbf{Error Handling}: Manages missing files, invalid columns, and recursive placeholder cycles (unresolved as, e.g., \texttt{<number>}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Analyze Card Type and Effect Mentions}
\subsection{Overview}
The Python script \texttt{parse\_image\_files.py} is a utility designed to analyze card data from a CSV file in the TTCG (Trading Card Template Generator) format and generate visualizations of type, subtype, and effect mention frequencies. Utilizing libraries such as \texttt{csv}, \texttt{matplotlib}, and \texttt{numpy}, the script processes card data to count occurrences of types and subtypes, tracks mentions of these terms in effect texts, and produces bar plots (and an optional 3D plot) to visualize the results (see figure \ref{fig:card_stat_plot} for an example plot). This tool is particularly useful for game designers seeking to understand the distribution and interactions of card attributes in a deck.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/subtype_counts.png}
	\caption{Screenshot of one plot output by the \texttt{parse\_image\_files.py} script.}
	\label{fig:card_stat_plot}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Purpose}
The primary purpose of \texttt{parse\_image\_files.py} is to provide statistical insights into the card collection, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Quantification of card types and subtypes across the dataset.
	\item Analysis of how often types and subtypes are referenced in card effects.
	\item Visualization of type-effect interactions for balancing and design evaluation.
	\item Optional 3D visualization of type vs. effect mention frequencies for deeper analysis.
\end{itemize}
It serves as an analytical tool to support data-driven decisions in card development.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data Reading}: Loads card data from a semicolon-delimited CSV file using \texttt{read\_cards}, expecting columns like \texttt{TYPE}, \texttt{SUBTYPES}, \texttt{EFFECT1}, and \texttt{EFFECT2}.
	\item \textbf{Type and Subtype Counting}: Counts occurrences of predefined types (\texttt{TYPE\_LIST}) and subtypes (\texttt{SUBTYPES\_LIST}) using \texttt{Counter} from \texttt{collections}.
	\item \textbf{Effect Mention Analysis}: Tracks mentions of types and subtypes in combined \texttt{EFFECT1} and \texttt{EFFECT2} texts, case-insensitively.
	\item \textbf{Interaction Analysis}: Computes two-dimensional counts of types mentioning types/subtypes and subtypes mentioned per type.
	\item \textbf{Visualization}: Generates bar plots for type counts, subtype counts, effect mentions, and subtype mentions per type, with an optional 3D bar plot for type-effect interactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage}
Run the script from the command line with an optional argument:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminalstyle]
$ python3 analyze_card_stats.py -h
usage: analyze_card_stats.py [-h] [--plot-3d]

Analyze and plot card type and effect mention frequencies.

options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --plot-3d    Generate an additional 3D plot of type vs. effect type frequencies.
\end{lstlisting}
By default, it reads from \texttt{DEFAULT\_CARD\_LIST\_FILE} (a constant from \texttt{ttcg\_constants}) and saves plots to the \texttt{card\_list/} directory. The \texttt{--plot-3d} flag adds a 3D visualization.

\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python 3.x with libraries: \texttt{matplotlib} (\texttt{pip install matplotlib}), \texttt{numpy} (\texttt{pip install numpy}).
	\item CSV file specified by \texttt{DEFAULT\_CARD\_LIST\_FILE} with columns \texttt{TYPE}, \texttt{SUBTYPES}, \texttt{EFFECT1}, and \texttt{EFFECT2}.
	\item Constants \texttt{TYPE\_LIST} and \texttt{SUBTYPES\_LIST} defined in \texttt{ttcg\_constants}.
	\item Write permissions to the \texttt{card\_list/} directory for saving plots.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The script is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{read\_cards(file\_path)}: Reads the CSV into a list of dictionaries.
	\item \texttt{count\_types(cards)}: Counts occurrences of each type in \texttt{TYPE\_LIST}.
	\item \texttt{count\_subtypes(cards)}: Counts subtypes from comma-separated \texttt{SUBTYPES} fields.
	\item \texttt{count\_effect\_mentions(cards)}: Counts mentions of types and subtypes in effect texts.
	\item \texttt{count\_type\_effect\_interactions(cards)}: Builds a 2D dictionary of type vs. effect term mentions.
	\item \texttt{count\_subtype\_mentions\_per\_type(cards)}: Tracks subtype mentions per card type.
	\item \texttt{plot\_data(...)}: Generates four bar plots and an optional 3D plot using \texttt{matplotlib}.
	\item \texttt{main()}: Orchestrates the analysis and visualization, printing results via \texttt{output\_text}.
\end{itemize}
Plots are saved as PNG files, with bar colors distinguishing types (e.g., lightcoral) from subtypes (e.g., lightgreen) in effect mentions.

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assumes a fixed CSV format with semicolon delimiters and specific column names.
	\item Does not validate the existence of the \texttt{card\_list/} directory before saving plots.
	\item The 3D plot’s readability may degrade with large numbers of types or subtypes.
	\item Case-insensitive matching in effects may overcount terms if they appear as substrings (e.g., "fire" in "fireball").
\end{itemize}








\section{Create Trading Card}
\subsection{Overview}
The \texttt{create\_card.py} script is a Python utility designed to generate trading card images in the TTCG (Trading Card Template Generator) format. It combines a type-specific background image with a level-specific star overlay and overlays customizable text fields, such as name, subtype, attack, defense, and effects. Leveraging the \texttt{Pillow} library, the script provides robust image manipulation capabilities, including text squishing for single-line fields and center-aligned text wrapping for effect descriptions, making it suitable for rapid card prototyping in game design contexts.

\subsection{Purpose}
The primary goal of \texttt{create\_card.py} is to automate the creation of visually consistent trading card images, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Customization of card attributes like name, type, level, and effects via command-line arguments.
	\item Dynamic rendering of text with automatic font size adjustment and horizontal squishing to fit designated boxes.
	\item Generation of standardized 750x1050 pixel card images with translucent overlays for seamless integration into game assets.
\end{itemize}
It serves as a flexible tool for designers to produce and iterate on card designs efficiently.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Card Base Creation}: Constructs a base image using type-specific PNGs (e.g., \texttt{fire.png}), overlays level-specific star images (e.g., \texttt{1 star.png}), and overlays the optional effect style images.
	\item \textbf{Text Rendering}: Supports single-line text with optional squishing and centering (name, subtype, attack, defense) and wrapped, center-aligned text for effects.
	\item \textbf{Fallback Handling}: Uses a white background or skips overlays if image files are missing, ensuring graceful error handling.
	\item \textbf{Stat Generation}: Automatically calculates random attack and defense stats based on level if not provided (total stats = level $\times$ 500).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage}
Run the script from the command line with optional arguments:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminalstyle]
$ python3 create_card.py -h
usage: create_card.py [-h] [-l {1,2,3,4,5}] [-t TYPE] [-n NAME]

\section{Card Maker UI}
\label{sec:card_maker_ui}

\subsection{Overview}
The \texttt{card\_maker\_ui.py} script is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Tkinter library, designed to create and preview trading cards in the TTCG (Trading Card Template Generator) format. It integrates \texttt{create\_card.py} for image generation and \texttt{generate\_random\_effects.py} for effect generation, offering an interactive platform for designing cards with real-time feedback. Utilizing a global \texttt{WIDGETS} dictionary, the script streamlines access to UI elements, enhancing code efficiency and maintainability.

\subsection{Purpose}
The primary goal of \texttt{card\_maker\_ui.py} is to provide an intuitive tool for card creation, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-time customization of card attributes such as type, level, name, subtypes, stats, and effects through a user-friendly interface.
	\item Immediate visual feedback via a live card preview, updated with each input change.
	\item Simplified workflow for saving card data and resetting the UI to default values, supporting iterative design processes.
\end{itemize}
It serves as the central hub for TTCG card prototyping, bridging user input with automated generation features.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Interactive Interface}: Three-panel layout with input fields (left), live 400$\times$580 pixel preview (middle), and effect generator (right), all managed via a global \texttt{WIDGETS} dictionary.
	\item \textbf{Dynamic Updates}: Automatically refreshes the preview using \texttt{create\_card.py} on input changes, with a \texttt{SKIP\_PREVIEW} flag to optimize reset operations.
	\item \textbf{Effect Generation}: Produces up to ten random effects from a CSV file, filtered by type and subtypes, assignable to card fields with a single click.
	\item \textbf{Stat Randomization}: Generates ATK and DEF values (total = level $\times$ 500) via a ``Randomize'' button or level selection, ensuring balanced stats.
 	\item \textbf{Auto-Filling}: The UI is intuitively designed to auto-fill some values, such as random ATK and DEF values, automatic type and name selection (when a named images are selected), and spell styles (for various keywords).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage}
Run the script from the command line with an optional argument:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminalstyle]
$ python3 card_maker_ui.py -h
usage: card_maker_ui.py [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

User Interface for card generation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE
                        Path to the input CSV file to process for effects. If not
                        provided, defaults to
                        'effects/effects_with_placeholders.csv'. The file should
                        contain a header row with column names.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to the output CSV file for saving card data. Defaults
                        to 'card_list.csv'.
\end{lstlisting}
The \texttt{-i} argument specifies the effects CSV file (default: \texttt{effects/effects\_with\_placeholders.csv}). Default UI values include ``Fire'' type, level 1, ``Unnamed'' name, and 0 ATK/DEF.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/ui_sample.png}
	\caption{Screenshot of the \texttt{card\_maker\_ui.py} interface, showcasing a random card being created.}
	\label{fig:card_maker_ui_screenshot}
\end{figure}

The UI consists of three main panels (see figure \ref{fig:card_maker_ui_screenshot}). The panel on the left is the primary stat panel for the card being created. This panel houses fields like the name, subtypes, level, image path, effects, effect styles, etc. These are the core elements that make up the card. 

The middle panel consists of a preview window, transparency selection (for various card art features), a save button, a reset button, and a spell search field. The preview displays a continually updating preview of what the card looks like based on the core input and transparency values. The update occurs whenever a main input loses focus (i.e. after the user typed in a name and selected away from the name text box). The reset button simple resets the UI to default values. The save button saves all card input to the appropriate \texttt{csv} file for storing complete card data. The spell search features is used when a card of type spell is being generated. The values selected in this spell search are used when generating random effects for the spells. Every option that is selected will be targetted as a keyword when generating effects for a spell card.

The panel on the right consists of the effect generation feature. The main generate effects button will generate a list of random effects from the list of all effects. If a unit is being created (non-spell type card), the effects will generate based on effects that are appropriate for units. When a subtype is selected for a unit, the first half of the effects will generate using the list of subtypes as keywords for which effects should be generated. When a spell is being created, this feature instead looks at the spell search rather than subtypes (since spells don't have a subtype).

\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python 3.10+ with Tkinter (standard library) and \texttt{Pillow} (\texttt{pip install Pillow}).
	\item Companion scripts \texttt{create\_card.py} and \texttt{generate\_random\_effects.py} in the same directory.
	\item Effects CSV file (e.g., \texttt{effects/effects\_with\_placeholders.csv}) and PNG images in \texttt{../images/card pngs/}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Depends on external scripts and specific file paths, requiring proper project setup.
	\item No current implementation for saving card data to a spreadsheet (placeholder \texttt{print} only) at the time of writing this - the tool is still being developed.
	\item Effect generation may produce fewer than ten unique effects if the CSV pool is limited.
\end{itemize}
